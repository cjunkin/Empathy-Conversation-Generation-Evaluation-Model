"<BOS> That's pretty vague, do you not know what you're doing in regards to a specific section of your life? Like school or work? <EOS>"
"<BOS> idk what a Red pill means exactly but my advice to you is if she treating you right then fuck her there are billions of other girls out there, and if u feel like in love with her and just leave her then try to not care and you have to accept the fact that some girls(as well as some guys) will lie straight to your face for years without any remorse. my advice is stop caring before too late. <EOS>"
"<BOS> I think it's social anxiety , that creates paranoid feelings , unless I'm wrong but that's how I feel <EOS>"
"<BOS> By any chance do you think you're in a loop. Junk food can make you depressed. And being depressed probably makes you eat more junk food? For a while that was my problem too. Even if its just random, ill probably binge and feel bad later. Only to indulge in more later to try to cheer up. <EOS>"
"<BOS> depression. not sadness which is caused by something and is healthy. Depression is an actual mental disorder which commonly goes untreated. The best things you can do for depression is first of all, not hiding it, tell your loved ones so they can help you. also get a therapist, very helpful and help you cope with depression and get over it. If you think really bad you can see a doctor and see if medication is a good idea. I take antidepressants and my depression is gone, it change you like I originally thought it would, it just makes me the same but not sad all the time. <EOS>"
<BOS> That's why I'm repeating 11th grade. It sucks. <EOS>
"<BOS> Ask your school counselor what resources they can give you. Just go into the office, ask for the counselor, and see what they've got. <EOS>"
<BOS> Is that really so bad? Maybe it was the smart decision because you needed that time to read recover. You're being kind to yourself when you need it and that's important. Hope you feel better soon. <EOS>
<BOS> Why can't you get a job as a lawyer? <EOS>
"<BOS> I don't want you to jump. I don't want you to die, in either one. I don't know exactly what you're going through but from the sounds of it, I'd suggest focusing on the parts in your life that you enjoy. <EOS>"
"<BOS> It's not uncommon. Bipolar can be very difficult to diagnose. We tend to think of it as a constant swinging between high and low but really you can be low all the time and still be bipolar if you had one high at some point. What you do is move forward with your new diagnosis and work on treatment and coping skills. ADHD and depression are generally easier to manage long term than bipolar disorder, so that's a plus. <EOS>"
<BOS> Expecting people to stop being depressed like turning off a light is extremely stupid. <EOS>
"<BOS> sorry to hear that, but been in a similar situation after taking some time off of school. My best advice is to take the minimum amount of classes possible so you get too overwhelmed. For me essential to plan my assignments in advance, so that I can just do things one by one and not let it all get piled up cuz then I wanna die. Also, if you need a break, take one. School will always be there but good to take care of yourself too :) <EOS>"
"<BOS> The generic answers heard over the years tend to go something like the following; exercise, sunlight, talking, therapy, stroking animals, eating healthily, meditation and writing one thing thankful for daily. I say with sincerity that any of those have worked for me but helped others. Keeping busy with hobbies on the days able to function might help. It does slightly for me. <EOS>"
"<BOS> Hey, just wait it out. I know what you feel. Sometimes I think I'm attractive, and sometimes I can't even look at myself I'm so disgusted. I've come to realize it's all just a fucked up mind game I play with myself. I doubt you're actually that ugly, you're probably kinda cute honestly, but if you're anything like me, you've tricked yourself into thinking you're ugly. If you want people to want to be around you, you have to do some basic things like showering, putting on actual clothes, smiling, excercising a little and pretending you have confidence. It's honestly dumb, but these things can be hard to do, especially if you struggle with low confidence and depression. But if you take care of yourself, it's not too hard to find people. And just you wait until you find a person to kiss on New Years, because the feeling is worth the wait. I know this is all a bit corny, but if you ever wanna talk about anything I'd be more than happy to :) <EOS>"
<BOS> No amount of 'you are not alone's from internet randos who won't reach out to you after will help. My local mental health system is an absolute joke and often made me more suicidal. So I also am alone when in crisis. <EOS>
<BOS> at least you got people trying to comfort you. I even dont have that. Again there are people who got it Much worse <EOS>
"<BOS> Does there need to be a reason? Depression is an illness, and like any other illness it doesn't need some form of justification, it just *is* <EOS>"
"<BOS> You're a good man, Median. I hope you know this. I hope that you have people around you that will tell your story for centuries, and that you live on as a hero in the minds of newer generations. But, I'd rather you live, personally. <EOS>"
"<BOS> Thats totally normal, most people get that from time to time. It will pass, the when is the real question. Good news is you can work on the when, at least it works for me. I think the key is to accept whatever you are feeling, not fight it and not try to change it, even try to get yourself to cry. The point is really to change your mindset from 'i have depression i can't cure it, it is killing me' to 'i'm sad again for no reason, human brain is a pile of shit and buggy as hell, I'm gonny cry all day to give it what it wants'.. <EOS>"
<BOS> Yes you are right from my experience.Not dealing with my problems. I isolated my family. It just came second nature.When they don't understand me.I kept busy on the shitty computer to avoid my problems. I realize that the worst thing i could have done. I need to try harder and put my family first who means everything to me. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't really think life is he'll but I don't understand the weird sadness or fear of death that people have. I've known a few people who died. I wasn't sad at all. Everyone I know is going to die and one day I am going to die. Why is that sad? <EOS>
"<BOS> No friends here, willing to listen. Need someone to listen to me sometime too. I'm going to bed right now, but if you want to message me I will get back to you tomorrow. <EOS>"
"<BOS> ive just sat in my room crying my eyes out thinking mostly about this. Conversations with people ive known my whole life i find difficult, its not natural. Everything feels so forced! im sick of trying so so hard to look normal. I hide my feelings from absolutely everyone and im exhausted. No motivation in life, feel like im a waste of skin <EOS>"
"<BOS> Omgosh. I just want to validate this feeling because I have been there. That said, if it's a matter of safety, there is no question. You know that you need to go. You just do it. It's not some kind of failure. You are taking care of yourself. It DOES super suck though. Don't let anyone tell you it's all fine and fun to go through that. I've been there. I've come out the other end and been okay for long periods too though so I mean, it doesn't stay like that. Hang on. It gets better. <EOS>"
<BOS> Write here one good memory of something nice happened recently. <EOS>
<BOS> What were you taking before vs what are you taking now? Are you being prescribed by your general doctor or a psychiatrist? Do you feel like you are in danger right now? <EOS>
"<BOS> I'm down in that hole. Don't get sucked in is my advice. You'll get nothing good out of it. The thing with alcohol is that, once you start drinking too much, too often, the idea that it makes you feel better is entertained while it is not true at all. It's: *I drink to forget, but I've drank so much I don't know what it is I have to forget. So I drink, just to be sure.* Alcohol and drugs have become a habit for me and I can't really live without them anymore. I need them to maintain a level of tolerable shittiness - but trust me, I'd be way less miserable if I never started it. <EOS>"
"<BOS> Thought I was ok and it passed away for half a year, but now it is coming back, and it hits twice as bad as before. <EOS>"
"<BOS> Get up and take a shower, and then go for a walk so you can clear your mind. That usually helps me after going through one of these periods. It sucks, but you'll get through it. And don't lose your job, you don't want to end up on the street. You're stronger than you think, there's just a cloud of depression around you that's obscuring your vision. Stay strong and don't give up. You can do this. <EOS>"
<BOS> well not for nothing but you made it extremely difficult to read your post by only using a period in the title. JUST saying not judging. <EOS>
<BOS> i used to. rn im in the area of not going to sleep so tmrw doesn't come <EOS>
<BOS> I mean fastest way is a pawnshop or trading stuff into GameStop <EOS>
"<BOS> If I had any will to do something good, I'd be doing it. <EOS>"
"<BOS> Okay, so feeling shitty is necessarily a shitty feeling. But, even subconscious you is empathetic and cares about others, which is a beautiful fuckin' thing to be. It's why you have the capacity to feel so bad, and it's also why you can (if you want to) be an amazing resource for people. Being able to feel things as deeply as you or I can is something to be cherished and protected and put to good use. The world could use more empathy, you know? It's okay to hate yourself too, btw. Just be honest with yourself about your good traits as well, yeah? &lt;3 <EOS>"
"<BOS> Each day repeats with the only change is it gets worse, preach man. <EOS>"
"<BOS> Pain's pain. There's no point in comparing our suffering to someone else's. Depression doesn't demand that you have a good reason. On a surface level, there's a lot about my life that people would even be jealous of, but that doesn't make me any less miserable. You're the only one living your own experience, no one else can say whether or not it warrants pain. If you feel something, you feel something <EOS>"
"<BOS> Treat yourself to some body lotion, chocolate icecream and maybe a glass of wine while you're at it. Couldn't ask for a more relaxing weekend than that. <EOS>"
"<BOS> I care, man. Hang in there, things will get better eventually. <EOS>"
"<BOS> Dude. broken my arm so bad that I needed a titanium rod. I was in hospital for 5 days. Let me tell you that it was the most depressing and humiliating thing ever. I was in a ward with a man who was dying from pancreatic cancer and another one who was about to have his legs amputated because of diabetes. It is absolutely miserable seeing them alone throughout the entire day waiting for a visit and sometimes they have anyone come over at all. Furthermore, the medical staff were stretched so thin that I had to scream and bear unspeakable pain for 45 minutes before I could get my shot of painkillers. This was after they had attached the rods to my arm. Oh and last but not least, absolutely humiliating to use the restroom or shower. I understand and appreciate the efforts the medical staff commit but I really help but feel embarrassed when they shower me or escort me to the restroom. wish to be admitted to the hospital. EVER. <EOS>"
<BOS> Mine is coming up and I am generally indifferent to it. I told my family I don't want to do anything for it. <EOS>
<BOS> Congrats on your birthday. I've never thought as well that i might see my HS graduation this year. <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe one day things will become brighter for you to see it in a better light so that dream job might be ideal <EOS>
<BOS> How did the trauma come about? <EOS>
<BOS> I hope you're still here. It gets better. <EOS>
"<BOS> If there's one thing I regret not doing, it's that I didn't kill myself when I was 12 and actually attempted it. It's been all downhill in the 15 years since. <EOS>"
<BOS> a motorcycle ride sounds super cool. i can't even force myself on my bike. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm trying to increase my self worth so I stop doing this exact thing. My frustration immediately gets taken out on the one thing I seem to hate the most: me. I've started to set small goals for myself every day so each day feels like a success when I achieve those goals. This has led me to branch out and actually put myself out there. In doing so I'm discovering a passion for mental health advocacy and rekindling a love for doing creative stuff. I'm not saying everything has immediately gotten better. Holy shit it hasn't. But this helps at least a little for me! Hope you can find omething that works for you. Let me know if you wanna talk about it <EOS>
<BOS> The good is worth it! Hang in there! You can get through this because you're stronger than this! You can make it through cause the good will be worth it! Lots of love! <EOS>
<BOS> i guess the idea is that have something strong enough to motivate you towards it. I personally have goals but I never have so I really help you here. <EOS>
<BOS> What does that mean in practice? Are you one of those persons who got tired of being used so now you use others? <EOS>
<BOS> Please know that someone out there cares for you and would be heartbroken if you here. <EOS>
"<BOS> When I read this, I had to think of a girl in our company. I saw her like 2-3 days a week, always with a sad face. So, one day I just asked her, if everything is allright. She said Yes, of course, thanks. How about you? I answered with I'm fine. But I don't believe you. If you're ok, why can't you smile for just... one moment? She said: ... I never knew, that it was that obviously. No one ever told me that. I answered: I guess plenty of people know that something isn't ok with you, but most people just care about their own shit or just don't know what to say. If you wanna talk... I'm here. She ended the dialouge with Thank you.... And she never wrote me again since then. I felt bad somehow. On the one hand, I just wanted to help, but she refused it somehow or I scared her too much. On the other hand... maybe I just made it worse for her, and that's of course not what I wanted. The human mind is a thing, no one can explain. It's infinite. <EOS>"
<BOS> Weed make my sorrow funny <EOS>
"<BOS> He's laughing at all of us, that sick fuck. <EOS>"
"<BOS> No time to find link right now, but Sarah Silverman said exactly this in her interview with Terry Gross on Fresh Air a few months ago. <EOS>"
"<BOS> I was like this at 16-18 all I wanted to do was sit in front of my computer and not leave the house. It wasn't like I was actually doing anything productive but on youtube / games I was just rotting and completely ok with it because it stopped me feeling that deep void inside and the negative voice. I am now 28. Iv'e managed to find a little bit more of a balance between technology and life but I am still depressed and cycle in and out of this. I would look into an addiction though, it is possible to be addicted to electronics (especially gaming and the internet). If you feel like you're agitated and your depression is linked into computer usage you might want to consider that your depression and negativity is linked into an addiction. <EOS>"
<BOS> I have the opposite problem. I eat and eat and eat when depressed. Sometimes when I have bad anxiety I eat though. <EOS>
"<BOS> very cool accomplishments! a photographer as well, love to see some of your work if you wanna share. at the end of last year my girlfriend of two and a half years left me, i had to move back home with my parents and lost all but one of my friends. but it pushed me to finally come out as trans and get hormone therapy. one year later and i feel like myself for the first time in 22 years. a few months ago i stood up to my shithead boss and quit my job working repossession. i really miss the money but miss slaving away for 80 hours a week and now looking into getting a job dreamed of since i was in highschool. sometimes things really do happen for a reason. <EOS>"
<BOS> I feel the same way. I'm angry and depressed. It takes a lot out of me emotionally to do little things like run errands. I hate interacting with people. They state at me funny and act like I'm scary which makes me angry. It's exhausting. <EOS>
<BOS> Personally I hate Christmas and all the Christmas spirit crap. <EOS>
<BOS> I just feel like I don't have a purpose. Like while I need things to survive. The things I need don't need me. <EOS>
<BOS> I was close to doing this so many times. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm here. I'll try to help. <EOS>
"<BOS> I felt this EXACT way when I first went as well. I felt like it was a grilling of my life, and I even tried to lie and say that I'm mostly 100% happy with my life and that I just wish I had more friends and cleaned the house more. YEAH RIGHT. I'm a mess a lot of the time and have so many problems I dont know where to begin. Eventually once I started to know my therapist and dive into the smaller issues, did she really start to open up and I opened up myself as well. Keep going. The first day is the hardest I think <EOS>"
<BOS> One of my old therapists used to tell me that these were still considered suicidal thoughts even though I actively planning to do anything. I always told her it was just wishful thinking. Lol. <EOS>
"<BOS> My current goal is to outlive everyone that cares about me. It seems like the nicest thing I can do for them, and it also grants me a chance to figure stuff out. All of my self-preservation instincts are driven off of the pain I would cause loved ones if something were to happen to me, in all situations, and that fear is what keeps me going during the worst of it. If you can't do it for yourself, try to carry on for someone you care about. <EOS>"
<BOS> It really is one of the worst feelings. My dog who was my best friend for 6 years was just gone one day when I got home. That was about two years ago and I still miss my buddy <EOS>
"<BOS> I'm sorry, my friend. I lost my mum too, two years ago. I feel your pain but it'll get better for you, I promise. <EOS>"
"<BOS> You got it all wrong. You should be looking forward to making more of those happy days, if you force yourself to be sad simply because you know you're depressed, you'll never get over it ever. Hang onto those days and strive to make more happy days each month. Depression is fed from negative thought process, let it starve <EOS>"
"<BOS> Everything is pointless, all our feelings are illusions because they are all brain chemicals. I don't see any meaning in life, there is no purpose, no happiness, no satisfaction. Why being happy/wanting to live is the normal quality of a human? Can't depressed be normal too? Is depression real? <EOS>"
"<BOS> What I can say that I can relate somewhat to your situation. Upholding social standard is hard and especially hard is keeping in line with what your family wants from you. You need to be able to find joy in new things, in what you find interesting currently, even if it isn't exactly accepted socially and your family might not like it. It's your life, not your parent's. <EOS>"
"<BOS> Not in the same way - I have a job (and prospects), I have some friends, but I live a life in solitude, since I cannot enjoy spending time with friends or people because it amplifies my depression - and I have no clue why. Maybe because I always feel alone, even when in company which makes me avoid it. So yeah, it's not what I'd call a life worth living and at least somehow related to your struggle. <EOS>"
"<BOS> Back at my old job, I used sick leave. <EOS>"
"<BOS> I think it's more like...suicide IS selfish, but so is asking someone to not commit suicide. So the argument is just kind of invalid because it's merely a question of who gets to be selfish. <EOS>"
"<BOS> Same, well obviosuly I don't know how you feel 100% but I thinks its appropiate to say I can relate to you deeply. Why don't we try distract ourselves, even if its just 5 mins. Listen to a song you like, watch a small video, browse r/eyebleach or even go drink water. Im gonna try and watch something in youtube to at least try and not think about you know what. Wannna try with me? :) <EOS>"
"<BOS> It took me seven years to get a bachelors, and a lot of that was done part time or online. Do it on your schedule. Nobody else's. <EOS>"
"<BOS> Its not silly, its cruel ;-; <EOS>"
<BOS> Except we're all driving on a flat plane <EOS>
<BOS> Revenge. . . On a life thrown away. <EOS>
"<BOS> Well yeah, but what about the relatives and the mess? <EOS>"
"<BOS> Hellow, is bad to hear that you're doing bad, I feel kinda the same, don't kill yourself, you're going to die anyway, so try and enjoy as much as you can. I hate how my life is right now, I feel empty and bored with everything/everyone, but.. **I love being alive**, you know, even tho existence itself has no meaning, we can just try and take the best out of it as long as we can. <EOS>"
"<BOS> Happy birthday bud :) Being a Virgo has its perks... this isn't one of them. Always a perfectionist, never happy with anything. I feel you man.. tomorrow is my birthday. <EOS>"
<BOS> same man I feel you <EOS>
"<BOS> Sounds like apathy to me. I'm guessing you feel kind of lost and without a direction and you just are following the path that you feel is required of you. While apathy is one symptom of depression, it doesn't necessarily mean that you have depression. By no means am I downplaying depression or trying to convince you that nothing is wrong because there isn't any on true definition of depression. I felt like you for a while, just a few small pleasures but nothing really else. For me, it went away after a few months. If you want to talk about it more or anything, feel free to ask anything. My only advice is don't give up now, because if it goes away, you'll regret a lot of things that you stopped caring about. <EOS>"
"<BOS> Really depends on the particular medication. Everyone responds differently as well. I have mostly had bad experiences with antidepressants, but I am not a good example. I know people who really improved while being on them. It is a bit of a gamble and it can take time to find the suitable med for you. I would say it is worth a try though. <EOS>"
"<BOS> Depressed since I was 9, I'm 23 now...I totally feel you, you are not alone. Thankfully life does seem to get better for each year that passes, I deal with the severe depression as it occurs and try to enjoy the times when it's milder. Good luck to you in life. <EOS>"
<BOS> Late at night is pretty much the only time I feel normal. Too bad I waste most of the night on sleep. <EOS>
"<BOS> As someone who's felt the same, what do you have? And I'm speaking objectively, because I typically don't want to admit that I have what I need when I feel as you do. Not that I'm saying that you do have a lot, but your post doesn't necessarily shed a lot of light on what's going on. It's easy, or it has been for me, at least, to say that I don't know what to live for, in the past. Somebody out there cares, man/woman, small or large. I don't know what your situation is, by your post, but feel free to message me if you want. <EOS>"
"<BOS> You deserve it! No one does! should yourself, though. Try to roll with it instead of beating yourself down more. You could comfort yourself instead and see what that does. <EOS>"
<BOS> Will pray for you my friend. Pray lift these things and issues up to God. Pray without ceasing. Put your faith and trust in the Lord that he would help you overcome these issues and struggles. I wish you the very best. God bless you my friend. <EOS>
"<BOS> YOU ARE NOT ALONE!!!! You posting here proves that. No matter what give up. There is always a better day, a better year, and a better life. There is so much help waiting for you. Talk it all out here if you need to, we judge and we can all relate. Please rob the world of your life! PM if you need help or need to talk, always willing to! <EOS>"
"<BOS> Exactly. Don't worry OP it will be ok, if one of your conversations got awkward just shrug it off, it doesn't fucking matter. If you see someone alone , go talk to them. If everyone is in a group just be like hey guys what's sup , again don't try to be weird just be yourself. People will accept you I promise. It's best if you try taking to one person, it has much better results so go do your thing <EOS>"
"<BOS> Yea, things go more wrong when happy. Kind of. Really I just get more nervous because I suddenly have that happiness to lose. When Im depressed it is what it is, but when like carrying a bag of money through a bad neighbourhood at let me lose lol. I be happy if not risking something. The risk and fear of losing the happiness, is part of how I feel good. Like, I feel proud that willing to take that risk. If that makes sense? Be careful with music, powerful. I have stuff I listen to because so good at effecting how I feel. Also, your brain releases a lot of chemicals when happy for the first time in a while, if ever had an extreme sugar rush, or done cocaine lol, it can be overwhelming. normal though. <EOS>"
"<BOS> Replace cutting with something else. When you wanna cut do something else. I smoke haha but seriously maybe theres other things that you might enjoy. Before I lost all motivation for anything I used to like running till my body hurt. It releases endorphins and other good stuff. I can vouch, I felt good afterwards. <EOS>"
"<BOS> Depression is a hard fight. I am 29, on meds and I still struggle. All I can add is to start with yourself. Keep a daily routine, like hygiene or reading, find something that allows you to clear your mind and be calm. Go to work or go to school and be yourself. Always find something that can make you laugh. A great sense of humor and a good personality can for real change the way people see you. I had terrible acne as a child and hated how I looked, but as I grew older I gained more friends through my humor. I only really have 2 friends but they are great friends. Quality over quantity and all that jazz. As for being single I too am in the double digit bus. I go from periods of loathing being alone to being numb to being okay with it. My friends and the things that make me laugh help ease that pain. <EOS>"
<BOS> When did you notice you're feeling crappy again? <EOS>
<BOS> Medication. My panic would feed on itself to the point where I'd have done just about anything to make it stop. <EOS>
<BOS> Dude don't say that man your family loves you and trust me you do not want cancer <EOS>
"<BOS> actually, you've faced the biggest betrayal up to date. Wether a bigger betrayal will happen in the future or not, you can't know. so if i were you i'd try to get over it. Life may be short but a betrayal is just an event in the story. Flip the page and carry on! <EOS>"
"<BOS> Even if I won't do it, other people will constantly do it for me. <EOS>"
<BOS> Should this really be in depression <EOS>
<BOS> Some days I just want to lie in bed and listen to sad or angry music. <EOS>
"<BOS> I just make up fantasy stories in my head until I do, maybe you could find something similar to do? <EOS>"
"<BOS> Yesterday was yesterday, today is today. Tomorrow is tomorrow. If you have one foot on the past, and one foot on the future, then you are pissing on the present. Think about that one. <EOS>"
<BOS> I was the smart kid getting straight As. Now I struggle to get Cs. <EOS>
<BOS> That feeling when your teeth are rotting away and you're too scared to go to the dentist. :( <EOS>
<BOS> Strangely.I feel deeply so I know I will always suffer deeply. <EOS>
"<BOS> I had this perception for a long time myself. But I realized eventually it's because I wasn't reaching out to them myself. I'm here, and I haven't forgotten about you. I'm here to help! :) <EOS>"
"<BOS> This is really sweet. Send her horrid memes, lol. Or maybe remind of something really funny that happened between you two in the past. You can mail a small box for like $5, mail her a letter and some of her favorite candy. Any small thing you can think of that just might put a smile on her face would probably help. Even if just a phone call or text. <EOS>"
<BOS> Have you tried admitting yourself anywhere? <EOS>
"<BOS> omg lol I 100% blame my parents. After taking an AP Psychology course at my school, it kind of shifted my own perspective on my depression. I know I can't claim to be an expert after reading just one textbook, but even an idiot can realize that your behavior and who you are is just totally as a result of your parents. The genetic aspects aren't their fault of course, but they are perfect human specimens, so you can imagine what 17 years of always being wrong has done to my self esteem and thought process. Strangely, being cognizant of that fact doesn't change it much. Of course, I've directly told my parents I blame them for who I am, and as perfect specimens, they told me that I can't keep blaming them for everything. There's truth to that of course, but it's rather incredible that they can find the gall to abdicate themselves of all guilt and responsibility. I'd better just get on my hands and knees and obey their every whim, since they're the ones who work and pay for my existence, regardless of whether or not I can actually do jack shit about that (child labor laws, yo). Lol sorry your post is just so relatable I had to rant. <EOS>"
<BOS> Do you see a therapist ? Maybe a medical treatment with a psychiatrist and regular appointments could help you ? I have been doing it it and it has been helping me <EOS>
"<BOS> I understand. You regret going to sleep knowing that when you will wake, it will all be the same. Nothing changes, same problems different day. But I have realized, slowly and painfully, that the changes won't happen unless I make an effort to try and change things Currently I keep getting pissed at myself for staying up as late as I do, drinking myself to sleep, and hoping that in the morning, something new will happen instead of what really is going on in my life. The point I'm hoping to make is that we need to make the effort of change if we really want to change how our life's are headed, and we need to hold to that change. <EOS>"
"<BOS> I can only recommend fiction (apologies; not much of a self-help/non-fiction kind of guy) but The Perks of Being a Wallflower (the film; never read the book myself) deals with depression among other things and is very powerful. Much of Sylvia Plath's poetry centres around mental health and depression, if that's of interest, and while it's not something I've read 'The Bell Jar' (which is prose) is also supposed to be very good, according to a former acquaintance of mine. And I recently finished watching an anime called Orange which was mostly very good at dealing with the issue, the one caveat being that characters tend to talk about 'saving' people quite a lot, which can be a little bit galling (lol). Music-wise, Brand New have done a number of songs which either deal with depression (or emotions that can be closely linked to depression) or are pretty evocative in that sense tonally-speaking. Can't think of anything else right off the top of my head but hopefully that's a fair amount of stuff, in the short-term at least <EOS>"
<BOS> Fucking true. Made some bad decisions including a drunk driving stint last weekend and now I'm trying to deal with the consequences. Feel like I'm being punished for being self destructive. <EOS>
"<BOS> been taking Zoloft for a few days and it made me more sleepy then ever. Today I only took half a dose (25mg instead of 50) and I feel less drowsy, but worse. <EOS>"
"<BOS> As a 24 year old that needs to go back to college and pay his way there. It is absolutely imperative you succeed in school to get tuitions for college. I know what you're feeling, well actually mine was worse since I had little friends but if I could back and give myself advice I'd tell myself to man up and do well, work out and socialize because the rest of your life is so dependant on how well you do at your age right now. Please believe in yourself and press forward. Although you have all the time in the world to make changes. Waiting it out will only lead to insanity and depression. It's a problem you don't want to deal with when your older. It's best done in the present. <EOS>"
"<BOS> not sure. I whine about life all the time but if I had the solution, use it right away. be gone tonight! <EOS>"
<BOS> I like to start with really tiny things and small moments. <EOS>
"<BOS> I used to imagine hoping myself out of existence, because wishes usually fail. In any case, I'm just recently starting to appreciate how all our lives are connected or rather it's a delusion to think there was never a connection to begin with, else itd be different. Anyway, it's ok to take some isolation to figure things out, but life's like riding a bicycle. <EOS>"
"<BOS> Introvert here, I still get super lonely I just stress out about what I would say to people and every single thing I can say wrong. <EOS>"
"<BOS> You're wrong. It's hard to trust and you may get burned, but you have to be willing to take that risk. There are people who care about you. <EOS>"
"<BOS> I'm glad your mother loves you and was there for you. I hope you are able to pass through this time and feel better. Perhaps find a local nonprofit to volunteer at. Something simple like a food bank, maybe a soup kitchen. That way, you can know that by being alive in the next few weeks, you have a direct purpose. It's something small, but it will make the lives of others better, because you lived. You can build from there and go on to help more people. <EOS>"
<BOS> I feel you. I'm only happy and at ease when I'm drunk. I'm sure I'd drink a lot more if I had more disposable income. <EOS>
"<BOS> What makes you think you're a shitty human being? I don't know who you are and I don't know your story, so pardon me if I'm coming as rude by saying this (that is not my intention, I'm solely trying to help), but maybe some of those reasons aren't founded. For example I often worry that all the people I love will abandon me, and even though it's not really founded and I know in the back of my head that it probably won't happen, it is still one of my largest fears. <EOS>"
"<BOS> You don't overcome it. You learn to live with it. Its who you are and there's nothing wrong with that. I find thrill seeking helps me. I'm sure it's not the most productive strategy, but it definately gets me to keep waking up. If you ever need to talk, feel free to message me. <EOS>"
"<BOS> The only way I'll exercise is if it's a real task that matters, like jogging to get to the bus stop on time or lifting furniture at work. I can't do the whole exercise for the sake of being healthy thing. I don't care enough about my health for that to work. <EOS>"
"<BOS> Well I will find out because I can't even stay hard anymore, so I'm giving up on it. Going from 7 times a week to 0. <EOS>"
<BOS> I always have herbal OTC sleeping supplements prepared in case that happens. Relaxing teas works too but then you are sleepy and have to go to the toilet. In many cases they work pretty well. <EOS>
"<BOS> Oh crap dude me too... I keep lying in bed all day and binge-eating junk food (like, an entire bag of hot cheetos and then more) and l always end up feeling even worse after but l can't stop. <EOS>"
"<BOS> What currently feeling. If you want you can talk to me. Rant it out, listening <EOS>"
"<BOS> Why the heck do we hate ourselves?! Man such as crappy lie we have bought from seriously the pit of hell. Nothing else could be so evil as to make us not believe we are worthy and deserving of a good life just as much as everyone else. Sorry to get weird there, it just makes me mad that anyone has to feel this way about themselves. Anyway, I have one scar on my arm from one time that I tried that and there forever. It still makes me sad when I see it. so sorry for what pain you are in. There will be a time in your future where you will not feel so much pain and will hopefully even feel better about yourself &amp; the future you will be so thankful if you permanently scar your face. <EOS>"
<BOS> Sometimes you got to find the right people to help you is all. I think you would be surprised sometimes the people who would be willing to help <EOS>
<BOS> felt like that before and I honestly know what happened to change it. pretty sure I just got so good at hiding it and acting happy just started to believe myself <EOS>
"<BOS> Maybe. Maybe its increasing because people are getting convinced by others that they're depressed? But it is a sickness, so that sucks <EOS>"
<BOS> not alone. PM me if you ever need someone to chat. <EOS>
<BOS> Haven't tried it but know a medical professional that says it really works for many patients. Not covered by insurance though. <EOS>
"<BOS> You are capable of doing things on your own. If your boyfriend doesn't make you happy, you don't have to be with him. If you are worried about coping, you can take things slowly, step by step. I should follow my own advice here as well: don't be afraid to seek therapy if you can. It will help, even if it only helps a little. As for your job, I'm sorry it didn't work out. But don't let things ruminate in your mind. Worrying about them over and over does nothing to help you. *Depression thrives in rumination*. Try looking into mindfulness meditation. It's not spiritual garbage, it's literally training the neural pathways in your brain to put less weight on particular thoughts, so that you don't get stuck in negative feedback loops. It takes time to change your brain structure, but it can be done. Another thing is to find distractions. Productive is better, but if you keep the less productive ones in check they can be helpful also. Delve into hobbies or learn a new skill. Be social and try new things. That's the best way to cope in my opinion. I need to take my own advice. <EOS>"
<BOS> Same. I drink every night. I look forward to 731 every night so both my kids are in bed and I can pour myself four shots of whiskey <EOS>
"<BOS> There are judgment free gyms out there such as Planet Fitness. Alternatively, you can buy your own gym equipment (e.g., dumbbells, resistance bands, etc.) / videos (e.g., P90X, Insanity) and work out at home. Exercising has definitely helped me with depression, but for me, it wasn't a magic cure. Exercising did bring many other benefits as well though, including health benefits, physical appearance benefits, confidence benefits, etc. So I highly recommend it <EOS>"
<BOS> That's an accurate description of the past 2 months of my life. <EOS>
"<BOS> If it was possible, we would live again but we are stuck in this. <EOS>"
"<BOS> I completely understand. The way I felt for my ex was unlike anything else. I never had such a connection with any other person before. It's been about 8 months since we've broke up, I'm still grieving. It's made me fall back into depression. I always thought I could do things myself, but I just realized recently that I can't. I can't always do things alone. I really just crave affection and appreciation. <EOS>"
"<BOS> Exactly the reason I stay away from Instagram, facebook, and snapchat now. Always makes me feel like shit <EOS>"
<BOS> I wish there was something to look forward to. <EOS>
"<BOS> Therapy: it works if you have a good therapist who helps you understand yourself; why you feel or don't feel certain things, ways you bring certain miseries upon yourself. Also if they are a champion for you. What I mean by that is they empathize with you rather than shoving psycho babble down your throat. They offer real tools for help. Also, you have to put in the work. Therapy doesn't fix anything. Just helps educate you on how to better handle yourself. Meds also work, but sometimes you have to try a few different kinds to find the best fit for you. They don't work overnight either; they can take upwards of 10-14 days in most cases before your brain starts to readjust. For me, I found my original dosage wasn't strong enough after a year or so and had to double up. <EOS>"
"<BOS> Unfortunately im thin anyway and through depression i lost weight because of no appetite.With 24 years of age i look like a 14year old boy. No beard ,just 56 of height. Fuck me. <EOS>"
"<BOS> I can't speak for you, but I don't do anything because I'm depressed. I used to do things but gradually started feeling worse when I'd go out. Now when I try to make plans I can never follow through with them. I feel so bad about myself that I can change my mind about doing things very quickly. <EOS>"
<BOS> Each year just keeps getting worse haha please end me <EOS>
"<BOS> I would totally cry at my desk, no one even noticed. <EOS>"
<BOS> All it does is make me feel worse because just feel selfish <EOS>
"<BOS> Very shitty. And you, OP? <EOS>"
<BOS> Sorry to hear that. Hopefully it goes by quick. <EOS>
"<BOS> I don't have any good advice :( , sorry. This absolutely embodies everything I have ever felt, thanks for at least finding the words. <EOS>"
"<BOS> After hearing every line in the book, I found this single post surprisingly helpful <EOS>"
<BOS> What help do you want <EOS>
"<BOS> Sometimes it's just the environment you're given, and you have to adapt. I'm very impressed actually that you're able to go to another job interview, it shows some hunger and motivation. And that's the blessing <EOS>"
"<BOS> Youa re comdemned to a life of freedom. Is an old quote i tihnk its from satre, but im not sure. And later there has been others who disagree. You are forced to become alive and aware that much is for sure. Unlike most animals you are a creature born with the abillity gather information and draw conclusion not jsut based on your senses, and that oftens leads to the question. Why am i alive? Not only that, you are forced into not just a world, but a particular part of the word, which then in turn will teach you values and conformaty, and for some people this works out well. If you can find it in yourself to look at the context you have born into and be satisfied with it, enjoy it and love it, if you can find shelter, food, sleep, joy, love and challenge in you enviroment. But for some of us, we don't fin those things, we suddenly find ourself in a enviroment that conflicts with our nature, the context of our existence is not operationable with the essence of our nature. You first statement i cannot, say is wrong, you didn't decide to exist, but netiher did you chose not to. And existing in of itself is not evil or good. But if the context of your life is making your life or nature feel haunted and painful. Then a there are options available. The first thing, no matter how you want to change your context for the better, rquires that you step back and see the context. Where are you from, what values have been impsoed on you, which makes sense to you which doesn't, how has these values been imposed, who has impsoed them. For these purposes your reasoning is a great tool. It easy to finda figure head or a single person to blame, but you really have to map it out, and see udnerstand ana analyse your einvirotment and the people in it, and then find the conflicts with your nature, the pain and sadness. Then you have to figure out a plan. And this is a tremendous task, not just do you have to think thoguhts you ahve not been taught to think, you have to be critical of a system that raised you and shaped you. You have to go against the nature of what normal is and accept yourself. And then you ahve to find out how you want to change the context of your life. alkohol amkes me miserable, and everyone i know drinks Find people you can exist with with out alcohol My father is violent Create an existence were you are independant from him School is terrible translate My class mates bully me daily Find another school thes are simple i know, and jsut examples. Now i know you asked why do i have to do all this hard work and i threw some of the most difficult work and ideas at you. But the things is all what ive jsut said is the reasonalbe arguemtn for you nature, essence and existence and a way to improve it. when you ask why, reason is not a tool that can answer. its like trying to build a ship using lead, sure maybe it can be done, but its deffinately not the best way. Refelection, abstract thought, contemplation, emotion, empathy. those are the tools to arrive at an answer. If reason was used, human life wouldn't really have value. If you were the head of state and only used reason, you would quickly realize, human lives are not what drives you foward, what makes progress and creates a super power. And lives could turn into numbers. Sure educated people anda strong work force is good reasonable arguments to have a population, but only if they are educated or strong. Using reason to determine worth of life can lead to terrible ideas or no answers. You have to work hard right now, because you are worth it depsise allt he pain you are in you are worth it, and you deserve to be your best you. And if you don't liek working 8 hours a day then sleep 8 hours and then have 8 hours for yourself. Then there are options, but because you born into this context you ahve to work hard to get to those oprions. It is hard to change your enviroment. You have to stay alive becuase, you know a humans life has worth and you are one. When you see another in pain you wish he wouldn't ahve to be, when i see your words and want to help you but am incapable i still try. You have worth because of all the thigns you have not done yet, and all the people who have not enjoyed you future self. Stay strong friend Love I wish i speleld better <EOS>"
"<BOS> I feel for you. Even minor setbacks can feel like major hurtles when depressed. found that setting small goals talking to myself positively helps. Maybe just start by trying to eat, shower, and get to sleep on time everyday. If you can do that, then consider the day a success. Having realistic expectations can help you be nicer to yourself. It sucks that going though difficult things and that may not fair, but gotta accept shit. Just work on the little things, my friend! So many things are out of our control. <EOS>"
"<BOS> If you do it, it counts. <EOS>"
<BOS> I feel like shit too everyday. I just wanna fade away. <EOS>
"<BOS> I think it is objectively pointless, humans seek meaning in things, and life has no definite meaning. For me, it's ironic, on one hand, I want to die ASAP maybe in my sleep, on the other, I want to live as long as possible to witness how far technology can reach, especially for astronomy and VR. I suppose what I'm trying to say is, as many had said before, we have to find our own meanings. We have to find 'joy' somehow, within this pointless struggle until the day we die. It's tough, I know, for I suffer the same. <EOS>"
"<BOS> Im sorry that guys are douchebags. But honestly there are better people out there. I promise you out there there is someone who wants to love you. There are always people who want to be your friend, like me! I hope that you wanna talk more. -Reaper <EOS>"
"<BOS> Medications work differently for everyone. Usually your doctor or psychiatrist will prescribe you with different ones depending on what you have tried that hasn't worked. I have personally been trialling all different medications for approximately 4 years now with no luck, I have been through almost all of the available medications. <EOS>"
"<BOS> Man, I fucked up really hard and my parents payed for it. I just fucked up again and they are paying for it again. It is the same mistake as before. I just keep relapsing and each relaps costs a lot of money and affects our relationship. I see no hope for myself, I will keep relapsing forever. I feel like killing myself would be the greater good. <EOS>"
<BOS> 33M here and gay. Never been in a relationship. Probably one of the most painful things to deal with. I feel like I might as well give up too at this point. <EOS>
<BOS> The reason I use to cut is I couldn't point to a part on my body and say it hurts here. It made me feel better at the time but it wasn't a real solution. You are in pain Broski. If that was me I would think that I had maybe an extra bad day/night and tried to fall back on old habits. <EOS>
<BOS> haha when I come back home I never even go out into my home town. I can't tell you how severe that problem is - if I met an old friend I'd black out...had a dream it happened...it's awful. That's the social side - could you imagine the questions?? What are you up to; what do you do etc. FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK that <EOS>
<BOS> You've built up a tolerance. <EOS>
"<BOS> I'm sorry, that is so sad!!!! It is a cruel world. But you make it better with your kind, sensitive heart. <EOS>"
<BOS> I know the feeling. I'm just so tired. I don't want to play this game anymore <EOS>
"<BOS> You could look forward to getting better. Slowly, and maybe never fully cured, but better. It's a good thing to aim for, unattainable as it seems. <EOS>"
<BOS> That was my first and last W <EOS>
<BOS> If I tried this I'd be getting up at 3:30am instead of 5:30am.... <EOS>
<BOS> You are not alone. Just remember that. <EOS>
"<BOS> That statement is bullshit. I'm the toxic, negative person in my life. <EOS>"
<BOS> Get some yummy ice cream!! <EOS>
<BOS> I agree. Last week I had a day where I was so happy and everything was fine. Then one thing didn't go the way I wanted it to and I was crying at work within the next hour... hate feeling like that too. <EOS>
"<BOS> Like crazy, video game all the time, im scared to not, getting really bored of it tbh, but cant do nothing, brain will kill me <EOS>"
"<BOS> It's usually innocent ignorance. Most people don't understand doesn't mean anything for what's true, except it's really difficult to have an illness that goes unrecognized. &amp;#x200B; <EOS>"
"<BOS> Oh, my family does that all the time. Like, what do you expect. Also, when they say they're feeling worse than I am for having to watch me depressed. Like, hello, I'm depressed here, not you. And when they try to blane it all on my anxiety and my negativity, like I'm to blame people generally don't like me. <EOS>"
"<BOS> It means that you have transformed your misery in a fundamental aspect of your identity and anything and everything that happens in your life is gonna be somehow linked to that. It is gonna become impossible to differ between what is truly a hardship from what you are deciding to see as such, because pain has settled within yourself to the point that things would not make any sense if it was not present, so you will inflict it upon yourself to return to the only state of familiarity that you know: being miserable. The term fetishizing is used in a harsh, accusatory, pejorative way, blaming the characters for perpetually watching their lives through the blackest prism, but the truth is they just do not know any better than to do so. Furthermore, fetishes are often believed to be shameful and obscene in nature, because such random, nonsexual items PRODUCE intense satisfaction, whereas people that are accused of fetishizing sadness are just sheltering themselves (if i fuck myself up, no one else will). <EOS>"
<BOS> Haha. Same exact medications. No. It did nothing. Didn't even notice it. <EOS>
"<BOS> Whats the fun in easy? We all die in the end... there is no reason to rush it :) nothing matters beyond what we want to matter, but if you conclude that life is meaningless and boring and hard then whats the point in that perspective? If it is meaningless then what else is there to be meaningful? what do you base those views off of if nothing else has a point for existence? Of course that assumes you actually think it's pointless or meaningless... or hard, which you do there for, how do you know something you've never experience is easier? Ah my rambling gets me nowhere because no one else cares to see it that way... eh oh well. Anyways, what is troubling you? <EOS>"
<BOS> What are you getting into? <EOS>
"<BOS> Hey, what's up? Why do you feel like this? <EOS>"
"<BOS> Yeah I'm all about this - fairly sure it's just a digital opioid but when I'm lonely they're always around for me. To be fair though I'm different than most ITT that I watch lots of documentaries, food shows, and makers. If you like food/fermentation and hilarious personalities I'd recommend It's Alive with Brad (from Bon Appetit) or Action Bronson stuff from Vice; and if you want a room full of weirdo friends, doesn't get better than the Chris Gethard show <EOS>"
"<BOS> I of course don't know your situation as well as you, but i think it could be worth a shot to organize something with a group of friends. That way, you are involved because you are organizing. Idk what's going on with you, but i think it could work out <EOS>"
"<BOS> I can relate, I hate having no structure at all. I just know what to do with myself all day, and I feel very lonely. <EOS>"
<BOS> I quit my job recently but I've been here for a year and a half. I'm so glad I'm leaving though. This place makes me suicidal. <EOS>
"<BOS> My best suggestion is to talk it out with someone you trust, explain the feeling you have and express what you feel like doing. If you continue to feel this way, seek help from a professional. Hope you feel better <EOS>"
"<BOS> I don't know if I know exactly. I've had feelings of contentment and I guess warm feelings, but I think it's more than that. I think the best way is to sometimes look at yourself like you are a close friend and treat yourself accordingly. Because actions make a huge impact and if you do things like removing yourself from unnecessary stressful situations and not committing self-sabotage (me sometimes lol), the road gets a little brighter. May you walk on warm sands, traveler. <EOS>"
<BOS> Aren't you proud about your kids <EOS>
<BOS> Why was the blonde excited about taking 6 months to finish her puzzle? The box said 2-4 years lol <EOS>
<BOS> Is there anywhere else you can go? A shelter or a friend's house or move in with a sibling or something? :( <EOS>
"<BOS> Same! I have lots of homework that need to be done, but I do it, driving me insane. I even do simple always so exhausted. Especially at school! <EOS>"
<BOS> I always wanted to die in my dreams because I'd like to believe I'd get to stay in them. Probably wouldn't happen that way. <EOS>
"<BOS> Not to sound harsh here, but do you have medical training? You shouldn't be diagnosing yourself. There are plenty of professionals who can do that for you and provide any help you may need. <EOS>"
"<BOS> It could be a medical condition, and you shouldn't be ashamed. I recommend you see a doctor about it. <EOS>"
"<BOS> You should talk to your other friends who you had in common, not with us here... <EOS>"
"<BOS> Not sure if you'll find this funny, but with each passing day, you *always* get closer to the day you die, natural or otherwise. Basically, suicidal or not, every day is a day closer to dying. <EOS>"
"<BOS> All the time man, still remember when i used to go outside, play with friends, not worry about anything and just live life till that one day when everything just fell apart i lost my friends, my motivation to go outside and be social, my parents trust its all gone and i can't go back <EOS>"
"<BOS> I support and am thankful for you, friend. <EOS>"
"<BOS> That's some poetic bollocks, right there. Don't they have two numbers? I've seen that someplace. <EOS>"
"<BOS> It's only about 1:45, there's still time to get some sleep, even if you're up early. Ultimately worrying about sleep isn't going to help you relax, and that's just going to make it harder to sleep. Try to think about something else <EOS>"
"<BOS> I can't remember the last time I went out with friends, I guess I'd have to have some first <EOS>"
"<BOS> Right now, I just fucked everything up <EOS>"
"<BOS> Yes, but I dont know how because Im very emotional. <EOS>"
<BOS> Did you think you might die from it? <EOS>
"<BOS> If she doesn't, you should ask about it. Talk at the beginning of the session and say I would really like to know your assessment of what's going on with me. I feel like it would really help me to know what you think, and what you think would help me get better <EOS>"
<BOS> Brilliant. I sat here and mulled it over. I really like it. <EOS>
"<BOS> Nothing to be afraid of, would your bf be embarassed to go to hospital after breaking his finger? No. Why should you be scared to seek mental help, broken finger hurts, depression if not treated can kill, and in the worst way possible. Go and find yourself a therapist, someone you can tell all about your problems. Hope it works out. <EOS>"
<BOS> I feel the same fuck school <EOS>
"<BOS> Here is a goal: get out of bed. I'm sure you are familiar with that crushing feeling where you just cant move because your depression is so fucking heavy. Just move a little bit. None is expecting you to be the fastest person in the race, we just want you to keep moving forward with us. A good goal is something achievable. On my broken days, my goals are to get up, take a shower, make a bowl of cereal. I'm a bit luckier than most, I have a wonderful wife and child, and they help me out when it comes to keeping myself moving forward. Just tiny things should be your goal. Eat an apple. Stretch. Take a shower, fuck, take a bath. Dont try to solve world hunger, just do what is possible for you. Message me at any time, we are all in this fight together. <EOS>"
<BOS> are you quiet or shy? that'll be why <EOS>
"<BOS> Terror and pain always wakes me up. I occasionally deliberately start fist fights with my brother (who is a body builder) to kick start things. Or hanging out volunteering with kids; shit is the best. You get to read to them, or fucking play with my little ponies or Legos, watch cartoons. <EOS>"
"<BOS> I've been on antidepressants for a few months now and I'm still very much myself. Honestly, I'm more myself now than before I was taking them, because now I can see the real me instead of it being blurred out by some dramatic cloud of self depreciation and suicidal thoughts. I've still got a long way to go and my depression is definitely still here but yeah. People take them because they help. I don't know where this idea that they turn everyone into emotionless robots comes from <EOS>"
"<BOS> Hey dude i used to cry everday on the bus looking back at my awful day, so i grew my hair out super long so no one could see it. Maybe its better not to cry <EOS>"
"<BOS> Actually, if it continues over a long period of time, it could be depression. You shouldn't be feeling numb all of the time. Are you also experiencing sadness? <EOS>"
"<BOS> I am as well. The person who meant most to me threw me out like I suddenly meant nothing, and replaced me. He's happier now too. <EOS>"
<BOS> Not a book but you should search up a spoken word poet on youtube called ' Shane Koyczan '. I was never into poetry until I heard some of his work. His voice is so passionate and calming and the visual effects help to focus.. for me anyway Personal favorites are: Troll When I was a kid To this day <EOS>
<BOS> I wish there was an easy way to die. Like one pill I could just pop. Unfortunately everything has to be messy <EOS>
"<BOS> It's a sad reality that everything comes to an end and that we're not given an exact explanation of why we're here or what the meaning of it all is. The way I see it is that we're here to give our life meaning one way or another. Since we don't know the meaning we have to make the meaning. Some people find that through their work, family, helping others, etc. Life is full of endless possibilities of what we can do with it. It's hard getting to the point where we feel like we're happy or accomplished but that in itself is another aspect of life and finding meaning. For some people it could take most of their lives to find the meaning that they were looking for and in my view I'd rather spend my whole life looking for that meaning and helping who I can along the way than to just accept that there's no meaning to it and end it since that's not really an answer. I may never get the answer myself but I can at least enjoy the journey leading to the end and maybe that in and of itself was the meaning all along. You'll meet many varieties of people throughout your life who will give you different perspectives of what meaning is to them and maybe that will help you on your journey and maybe it won't. We have the time we're given and what we do with it is dependent on us. Even after we die and join the rest of the universe in it's infinite there'll still be people around who will say, Hey remember u/OkayScience, I want to do what he did and live my life to its fullest. We can still be remembered for the life we lived even after we're gone and in that way we'll essentially live forever. This is the way I see life and it helps me from time to time. I still have my bad days and sometimes consider if it's all worth it but then I just keep going because I won't know if I just stop here. Plus it helps talking to people about it at times and if you do feel like talking about it more feel free to send me a message. Keep going with the journey and stay strong since you'll find your meaning in time. <EOS>"
<BOS> Are u boy or girl?? <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. Doing anything is good. Specially these things that are just for yourself. It can be hard or even seem silly but if it is something you had to convince yourself to do and then managed to do it. That is good. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm sorry. I wish I could help. I feel the same way. <EOS>
"<BOS> Yeah. My parents took me to a psychologist when I was a teenager, and that was one of the questions she asked me. I felt two things. 1. How would I know? I don't know what normal is. I only know what my experience is. How would you? How could you even measure that? It's not like there are distinct and separate thoughts you can count, it's just a flow. 2. What kind of terrible precedent does that set? Since when is thinking bad? <EOS>"
<BOS> I'm sorry man. I wish I could take the pain away. <EOS>
"<BOS> If you don't count my mother or family members, about 3 years. <EOS>"
<BOS> What have you been failing at? <EOS>
"<BOS> I want to repeat other comments, but do it. There is nothing afterwards, this is your one chance and you have to make it count. Life is like a train ride, there are turns, twists, hills, curves, but sometimes there are tunnels. And when your in the tunnel for a while you look back and forward but see nothing but darkness, it feels like it is all that is has been and will be. But tunnels always have an end. This train ride of life will get you where you want to go, as long as you get off early. <EOS>"
"<BOS> I guess for like short moments everyone has done it, but most wont remember it since it wasn't really a serious thought, just a quick idea. <EOS>"
"<BOS> Ask them what's wrong, what's troubling you, how do you feel, what did you do today, how did it begin, when did it begin. But don't ask like you're interrogating them. Say it in a nice tone. Don't say it gets better, or life is worth living, etc. It's annoying to the person, always. It's nice how you care for them :) <EOS>"
<BOS> Well fair enough. I'm sorry there isn't anything I can say to help :/ <EOS>
<BOS> That's my dream. Just hitch a ride to amsterdam and try to find some job <EOS>
"<BOS> Thing will only start looking up when you do. Its ok to feel down and hurt for a bit, but don't let it consume you. I briefly looked through your post history, you're going through a break up, it's understandable. I am also going through a break up and depression came with it. You gave your heart to someone and expected them to so the same. When they didn't you became devastated. The truth is you're a loving caring compassionate kind person and deserves someone who wants you always. It will work out, things will get better but you have to try and make them better. <EOS>"
"<BOS> hey, wanna talk? im here for ya if ya want! <EOS>"
"<BOS> My hairdresser place always washes your hair and is still relatively cheap, I tell you those 5 minutes feel so damn good. It feels so nice to be touched, especially by a woman. Sounds creepy, but Idc <EOS>"
<BOS> I'll be thinking this all night tonight. <EOS>
<BOS> HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!! I'm glad it's a good day! <EOS>
<BOS> That's a bit dark. How did you get here? <EOS>
<BOS> Some days depression can be worse than others. Just try to make it until tomorrow. :) <EOS>
<BOS> I always say Still alive <EOS>
"<BOS> Good, glad. Do your best at work and I wish you the best :) <EOS>"
"<BOS> Of course you don't have to be perfect. As long as you're doing your best, that's all you can do. Everyone makes mistakes, no one is perfect. Hang in there bud. <EOS>"
"<BOS> wanna talk? msg me if ya want. im not gonna tell you what to do or why your life is not fucked. but im someone to talk to and i have been where you are and might understand you, in some way. <EOS>"
<BOS> You're not alone with that. <EOS>
<BOS> It can. It didn't work for me (only get worse) but maybe it will a good experience for you. I really hope ... <EOS>
<BOS> Therapy and meds. I go to support groups every Thursday. I avoid alcohol. I read and write everyday. <EOS>
<BOS> If you are not happy and you are not ill then you need to do different things. <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe that is why we all are naturally depressed <EOS>
"<BOS> The same advice applies to them in one regard. Need to know sadness to really be happy. It sucks that depression is part of my life, but it gives my character a unique value that is missing in others. Still would rather feel good without falling back into the void every time. <EOS>"
"<BOS> Lmao that's my plan honestly. Got sick of it, can't stomach shelling out $700+ a month when I earn $8 an hour just for a shitty apartment I'll never have time to spend in because I'm worried about making the rent for it. It's depressing and monotonous. I'm personally building a van to live out of right now, I plan to leave in the summer. I think of you have any itch to get out there and do something that makes you feel whole you should do it. I've dealt with depression long enough and frankly I'm sick of it, so I'm trying something a little new. Travel, fresh people, fresh scenes, fresh work. It won't be the most luxurious life but it'll probably provide more than the norm of working all day every day. <EOS>"
"<BOS> All the time. On paper, my life is fucking fantastic, but I'm still always sad. And I don't know how to make it better, because everything's already pretty great <EOS>"
<BOS> Does it matter at that point what I want? They're the ones left making sense of it. Let them do whatever they want. <EOS>
<BOS> Yea i wish I had someone who truly understood. <EOS>
<BOS> I also call it going to bed... But its 1 am my time and I'm still too awake to sleep <EOS>
"<BOS> When i have good days i think about what was different. Many times my good days are ones i spent someplace else by myself. Like a town the next county over, for example. Recently i went into a city at dusk and just walked around by myself. I was never alone but i wasn't around anyone who knew me. It was good. Didn't end the dep but it was good. <EOS>"
<BOS> like all emotions have been blocked off from me.. <EOS>
"<BOS> What seems to be weighing you down lately? If you need someone to talk to, I'm here. :) <EOS>"
"<BOS> Then makes some, and create your own future. Not the one you think people expect of you <EOS>"
"<BOS> Perhaps that's not such a bad thing for the time being - at least it sounds like you're still doing the necessities of life whether you want to or not and whether there's anything resembling pleasure in it. It seems that's how I've been operating for a few years myself - doing things because I have to not because I want to. At least we're doing them, maybe we'll get our mojo back and want to do something later. <EOS>"
"<BOS> Hey there, feel free to pm me if you need to chat. No judgments from me, just ready to listen, so feel free to say anything you want or need. Please stay strong. <EOS>"
"<BOS> Hey i feel ya, today is my 20th bday, Im drunk in the middle of the day and thinking how to end everything asap <EOS>"
"<BOS> really depressed right now and I feel like it helps me been drunk that past 5/6 days and as soon as I sober up I feel like I do anything . I suppose the hangovers make it worse for a few days but when drunk worth not feeling as bad as I do when not drinking, I stand being sober and dealing with my thoughts. a bad cycle but I like to drink until my life kinda brightens up a little bit that way easier to be hungover <EOS>"
<BOS> for me i think its a little of both <EOS>
"<BOS> you can get through this i promise. hang in there, just get through the day. tomorrow is a brand new day. <EOS>"
<BOS> Does your school have any counseling or therapy? I think depression amongst grad students is way too common <EOS>
<BOS> You have one of the best names ever seen. <EOS>
"<BOS> Lots of cannabis, which I can't even use much anymore since I lost my job <EOS>"
"<BOS> I tried one once. It was a cool experience, but I'm also afraid of the dark, so it was a little anxiety inducing (they had a button to turn the lights on though). I don't know if it's really helpful, but it's still something I'd recommend, even if just for the experience <EOS>"
<BOS> I have many times i have made plans and let them go i want to try agean just to get away from it all i just want to hop on a train and go whare it goes and maby be hapy for once in a long time sorry for bad gramer and bad spelling <EOS>
"<BOS> I trust my dogs and cats more than humans. Humans are fallible. Animals are just who they are. When it comes to trust in humans, it comes down to expectations. What are your expectations? When you enter into a relationship, it is something you should talk about. If you don't, you will find that everyone has different expectations. And you will never find a relationship in which you can trust. <EOS>"
"<BOS> Yes. And i do like some company. I'm a confused person. Sometimes I like being alone, No one around me, sometimes I want someone with me . <EOS>"
"<BOS> That's wonderful news, you should be proud of that progress. <EOS>"
"<BOS> My gut reaction is that if you were just insisting in wallowing in misery, you wouldn't be wondering about this. <EOS>"
<BOS> I feel the exact same way as you do and I'm tell my self that I'm fine. If ever want to talk about PM. I feel when you talk about your lonliness it helps to get through. I use discord and WhatsApp if that's your thing. Don't be to hard on yourself everyone in the world is loved by someone. <EOS>
"<BOS> I think porn and affection are different really. You wouldn't love a friend just to fuck them, you love someone emotionally. Do you have a tinge of 'why the fuck did I do that' after watching porn? I used to see a lot of shit. It takes time to quit this drug that controls your actions. I hope you find someone, I haven't, but I just try and remember friends, cute girls, whom I'd never imagine in that situation. Buy a scarf and choke yourself until it hurts if you want to think straight. <EOS>"
<BOS> Having a drink is okay now and then. Most do it even when they aren't depressed just to feel relaxed. If you have problems with it then yes it can be bad for you. <EOS>
<BOS> Same I'm tired of waking up exhausted even though I get a good amount of sleep. Life is general is bullshit <EOS>
<BOS> I know the feeling :( <EOS>
"<BOS> Misery loves company...I just moved to a new state a month ago. Quit my job, left my family. The only friends I have right now are my landlady and realtor. It's really fucking shitty some days. Hang there if you can. <EOS>"
"<BOS> I just sent my support out, it should arrive in a few weeks, $3.95 shipping charges. <EOS>"
"<BOS> being depressed means you're almost as sad as you can get, the fact your thinking about your friend is how you know you cared. Most people don't care enough to do that once they've cried a little. <EOS>"
"<BOS> I can't deal with it, I just push through everyday <EOS>"
"<BOS> By spending time with people, in person. You'll probably fuck up a lot, make lots of social faux pas, feel like your the biggest idiot in the world (I do pretty regularly). However after a while you'll get better at being a 'normie'. Well as normal as people can be. We're all a fucking mess with no idea what we're doing, we just find other people who are a mess that are fun to hang out with. <EOS>"
<BOS> Preferably neither but if not an option then just run. Just die <EOS>
<BOS> What day is your birthday? I turn 17 on February 6th! Do we have the same birthday? <EOS>
<BOS> I did several months on citalopram but eventually got moved onto escitalopram. I'm now taking Wellbutrin with the latter. Much improved. <EOS>
<BOS> I hate it when people say that. It makes you feel so guilty for whining. <EOS>
<BOS> currently in a relationship. I keep thinking going to breakup with me or cheat on me. My anxiety fucks it all up. <EOS>
"<BOS> Happy birthday dude, it's actually my birthday as well today! <EOS>"
<BOS> I'm the opposite of this. I just ask Can today be worse than what it already is? And Can it be worse than yesterday? Somehow it always manages to get worse. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't but I wish I did :/ <EOS>
"<BOS> Yep, I was actually feeling pretty good about myself this morning, but now a total 180 and I think a disgusting freak never going to find love... I hate myself <EOS>"
<BOS> I even put up with bad books. Anything that gets me thinking about something else. <EOS>
"<BOS> Whoa, easy. Whoever she is, and whatever you did, chances are not as irreparable as you think. Time will heal most wounds. And if it is really irreparable, then you move on. One incident is not indicative of your worth as a human being, nor does one opinion determine whether you are good or bad. It might hurt to move on, like *really* hurt, but alright. normal. <EOS>"
"<BOS> I'm going to buy a few lemon plants and plant them in a cute Groot pot just for this reason. Btw, have you considered getting a pet? I don't like pets (bad childhood experience with wild dogs) so it's not for me, but generally people who like keeping a plant alive would love to have a happy, living pet around them <EOS>"
<BOS> Some people are sensitive. Don't change the good things about yourself just because some people don't understand silence. <EOS>
"<BOS> start with something smaller, like a hermit crab <EOS>"
"<BOS> When I can't sleep I've taught myself to use it. If I can concentrate I read, if I can't I play video games. Anything that helps me to relax. I tend to find that I need to distract myself from being unable to sleep, otherwise it makes me anxious and that makes the sleeplessness worse. <EOS>"
"<BOS> I think accepting that you are YOU rather than that you are ugly could help. Because you ARE you. You're no one else, and you never will be. You have one body, and no matter how you feel about it, it's all you have. You don't have to like your body at this point, just accept that it is yours. I just try to accept the intrusive thoughts for what they are: intrusive thoughts. They're intruding. They don't belong in my head. I don't have to listen to them. They can be there, but they don't have to mean anything to me. I'm stronger than they are. I know the truth. They're just trying to confuse me. That sort of thing. The more you can view them as a separate entity from yourself, the easier it gets, in my opinion. <EOS>"
"<BOS> Antidepressants, therapy, naps, bubble baths, tea, cat snuggles, books, watching movies curled up on the couch with a pillow and blanket, time spent in nature, a good cry. Hang in there my friend. <EOS>"
"<BOS> You are not alone in any of that and my heart goes out to you and I think its important to seek professional help for these types of feelings, im sorry i couldn't help more and hope you get better <EOS>"
"<BOS> Hey. I know who you are, what doing or even thinking right now, but I do hope that still here for now at least, and reading this comment. really sorry for how feeling right now, and even though been through this for the last 2 years already, I say that I understand how you feel; even though I wish that I could. But please, please know that if you still need to talk, you could message me yeah? This truly is a really shitty world; but in light of all this, there are still people who are genuinely kind, who would really want to help. Being a beacon of light for those who are still suffering and letting the light from others shine onto you; this the purpose of living? The purpose of still staying here? <EOS>"
<BOS> Hugs. You do matter. Depression tricks you into thinking the worst. <EOS>
