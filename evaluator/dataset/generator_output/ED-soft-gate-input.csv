I have more than enough, yet there are moments where I feel like there's no hope nor a bright future waiting for me. I feel alone and abandoned even though I have friends who know that I am depressed and am like this sometimes. I get so frustrated when I can't find out why I just can't be normal.

I have gained weight in the past 3 months, everyone has noticed it all my friends and family. I have never been depressed nor ever felt like this really, only up until maybe 5 months ago. The thing is that I have not had anything traumatic happen to me to make me feel like this. I've had family problems but I don't really see that as a problem i've dealt with it for many years.

But I think more and more about drinking every day, and I wonder if it will work to mediate the symptoms just a bit.

43,"I'm contemplating suicide via ruining my life.. If I can't do it quickly, then I'll do it slowly. I'm in no rush. I mean fuck it.

52,I feel so alone. And it hurts so much,i 'm sorry to hear that . why do you feel that way ?
53,"It would mean so much for someone to just notice something is wrong and ask if I'm okay. Just once, I want someone to know I'm spiraling down without me having to pour everything onto them. If they'd just be interested enough in my well being to *ask*...",i am sure it will be ok

59,"What did you live through in 2018?. Every year, my mom has the family reflect on things that we've gotten through during the year. Good or bad, we made it through something. So now, I'm asking you the same thing: What's something you lived through in 2018 that you can now say, I made it through. &amp;#x200B; What I lived through: losing all of my friends but making a new one, concerts, trip out of my home state, and making photography work I can be proud of now, getting on stable meds.",that sounds like it 's always good to have a supportive family .
60,"Depression and Anger are best friends if not the same entity.. I'm at the point in my depression spectrum where everything makes me angry. All day I experience silent rage. Things piss me off more than they did before. And this is the way i isolate myself without knowing it at times. My family tells me they don't know who I am anymore, they ask why I'm mad all the time. My partner does not get fair treatment from how shitty I treat him. My whole life is that feeling you get when your mom tells you to take out the garbage right before you're about to go sleep. Little inconvenience after little inconvenience turns into full on discomfort being awake and always being pissed off you have to do anything at all. I don't know how to not be mad anymore and it scares me.","i see , i know it is a learning experience ."
61,Anyone else have a hard time this time of year? Looking for some help.. I have 2 kids and am having such a hard time getting into the Christmas spirit. The darkness makes me tired all the time and I feel like doing anything but going to bed.,i 'm not sure i could do that

65,Got back from therapist.. and it was useless... she only questioned me why i dont work and why i dont have any meaning in this life... useless visit for a useless person.. well i guess its time to stop this..,i 'm sorry to hear that . what was wrong with her ?
66,"Have you ever just stared blankly at a car's headlights as it speeds towards you, wishing that it would it would hit and kill you instantaneously?. You close your eyes accepting the promised bliss of death... and the car stops. You slowly sink bank to reality as you open your eyes again and walk on.",i am glad you are able to get some way to mess with that .

70,"I hate the good days. I'm really starting to hate any good days that I may have. I get one every month or so and it's quite possibly worse than just being depressed. It dosent matter how happy I am or how much I try, I know it will be right back. And worse than a normal day. After a few hours I fall right back down. I honestly don't know why I'm still alive. My life has just been a series of fuck ups. I should be a functioning adult by now and yet I can barely think straight. I'm just running in circles, I do the minimum to survive. Daydreaming is my only escape and even my depression is inhibiting that. Why, why me, why any of us. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.",i can see why you were so much more considerate . you should try to do that .
71,"Maybe I'm not depressed. Maybe I just don't like living.. I mean, I don't seem to have ANY depressive symptoms except being generally dissatisfied with life and being suicidal. None of the drugs worked. None of the shrinks helped. Maybe living really is just a shitty, boring thing in aggregate.",i understand that . i do n't have to be alone in a haunted house .
72,I feel numb. This year has been so hard. I have never felt loneliness like I have this year. Overwhelming feelings of sadness and despair wash over me as I am just walking long the road or sat at work. It takes so much energy to pretend to be normal for family or colleagues. I am so tired. My day used to be happy. I used to find joy in things but there is no joy left. But I know that I don't feel empty. Far from empty as there is so much darkness inside me. I feel numb. Does anyone else feel nub?,i can understand that
73,"Anyone else has nothing worth living for?. No friends, no job prospects, no romantic success to look forward to. Makes life look like an utterly pointless waste of time. Anyone else struggling with this?",i get that movie lol
74,"Anyone take mental health days from work?. Do you use vacation, PTO, sick, FMLA?",that is a good attitude . you are doing a great job .
75,"Depression shower thought. Common saying out there that suicide is selfish, but what a lot of non-suicidal people don't understand is that people who are suicidal know that the people around them will have better lives if they were not in it and know that being alive is selfish.",that is so sad . i 'm glad you have a lot of good friends .
76,"Sometimes I wonder why I even try. I've never really overcome depression, because it always comes back worse than before. This is the worst I've ever had; I can't go more than 5 minutes without thinking about suicide.",i am sorry to hear that . i hope you do n't have to work out !
77,"I have been a Freshmen for 3, 1/2 years. I don't even blame my depression , I am just dumb. I was at community college for three years and now I am on academic probation in a university, this is my second semester here and I only have twelve credits to my name. I am trying , I really am but it's just hard and hopeless. The other day my parents told me we made room for your future degree , next to your siblings degrees! I am twenty-two years old going on twenty-three. I don't know what to do.",i 'm sure you 'll be able to go there . it 'll be a lot of fun .
78,Its silly how out of the blue it can hit you and ruin everything you built mentally up to that point.. especially during the ACT. fuck me.,oh wow ! that 's a lot of money . what was your favorite thing ?
79,It’s like I’m driving with no driving wheel. And just wishing for the car to hit a wall,oh no ! that is so scary ! i would be terrified too .

82,Anyone feel numb/epmpty. I don't really know of its depression but I figured you guys could help. I have this number feeling where I just don't feel emotions other then sad or angry I just feel empty. Like I'm just a shell with nothing inside just going through life. I don't really know what to do with myself I don't want to kill myself because it would hurt the people I care about most but at the same time I can't feel anything other then everything suck why am I here. It's really tough to even get out of bed in the morning all I want to do is cry. Does anyone have any ideas on coping with this numb/empty feeling because nothing makes me happy.,i 'm sure they 'll be able to help you . i wish you the best of luck !
83,"Today is my birthday. I should be happy and shit, but I'm just empty. Does this happen to you, when you should be happy but your just empty? This sucks. Want this shit to end","i am sorry to hear that , i hope you get a raise !"
84,Idk. It's 5 am and everything is hitting at once,"oh no , what happened ?"
85,"Do any of you guys feel like me?. For some background, I'm 18 and in my freshman year of university. For a couple months now I've just been feeling sorta weird. It's like a long funk. I don't know how to describe it. If I had to choose, I'd say I feel empty or indifferent. I'm still able to laugh and find things funny, but a lot of the time I just feel like a machine, doing things because I have to. My motivation is minimal. A part of me is just not transitioning very well from high school to university. I don't like it here and I don't know how to describe it, either. Maybe out of place? Not fitting in? The environment here is just cold. I've been looking forward to sleeping more lately, but I dunno if that's just my exhaustion from late night studying/work or something else. I think I failed my chemistry exam and the course and it doesn't really phase me. I don't know what's wrong. Am I depressed? Do you guys feel similarly?",that 's true . i 'm glad you 're able to do it .
86,"I'm curious about how anti-depressants have affected you. I've been dealing with depression since I was 12 (I'm nearly 19 now) and in the past, my doctor recommended anti-depressants. I was hesitant because I've had friends say it essentially makes you feel like an emotionless robot, so I ended up declining that option entirely. I feel like my depression has only gotten worse and worse and am now looking to meds as a last resort. To anyone currently/previously on anti-depressants, could you tell me how it's affected you both mentally and physically? Thank you all &lt;3",that is a good idea . i 'm glad you 're able to finish it .
87,I've had depression since I was 8 years old and I am now 21 years old with no recovery.. This makes me incredibly scared of my future...,i am sorry to hear that . i hope you get a lot of relaxing !
88,Does anyone else feel normal late at night?. I find myself depressed mostly morning-evening. However I feel content and relaxed late at night,i 'm sorry to hear that . i hope you get to go soon .
89,"Feeling dead inside. For the last 1-2 weeks feeling nothing inside, like most of the other people, dont know what to do. Thoughts in the middle of the night well, i might die, i dont have what to live for. Literally void of nothing, black space.",i hope it was n't too painful .
90,"Feel like I'm forgetting what enjoyment is. Time with my partner doesn't feel fulfilling, not like it did. Even my zoo job feels routine; I don't do much there, and today, I feel dull to it. I hate this; I don't deserve numbness, I should be grateful for my life. Depression, thieving fucker..",i 'm glad you got the help . it seems like you 're doing it !
91,The 20's. Are the 20's supposed to suck this bad. I want to fast forward to when my life gets better. Kind of like a click remote.,"oh , that is always a great feeling ."
