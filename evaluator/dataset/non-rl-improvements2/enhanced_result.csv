I have more than enough, yet there are moments where I feel like there's no hope nor a bright future waiting for me. I feel alone and abandoned even though I have friends who know that I am depressed and am like this sometimes. I get so frustrated when I can't find out why I just can't be normal. Everything was alright about 2 hours ago, but it just changes so quickly and hard that I almost feel suicidal. I'm a fucking mess...",it 's good to have a way to learn from it

Going back to school has been difficult for me, It's been around five years since I've been in a class room and I ask the teachers and the people that I go to my classes to cut me some slack for being rusty but they tell me that it doesn't matter, and my step mom doesn't want me to use the computer because she doesn't want to share.

I have gained weight in the past 3 months, everyone has noticed it all my friends and family. I have never been depressed nor ever felt like this really, only up until maybe 5 months ago. The thing is that I have not had anything traumatic happen to me to make me feel like this. I've had family problems but I don't really see that as a problem i've dealt with it for many years.

60,"Depression and Anger are best friends if not the same entity.. I'm at the point in my depression spectrum where everything makes me angry. All day I experience silent rage. Things piss me off more than they did before. And this is the way i isolate myself without knowing it at times. My family tells me they don't know who I am anymore, they ask why I'm mad all the time. My partner does not get fair treatment from how shitty I treat him. My whole life is that feeling you get when your mom tells you to take out the garbage right before you're about to go sleep. Little inconvenience after little inconvenience turns into full on discomfort being awake and always being pissed off you have to do anything at all. I don't know how to not be mad anymore and it scares me.","yep , i would be worried about that ."
61,Anyone else have a hard time this time of year? Looking for some help.. I have 2 kids and am having such a hard time getting into the Christmas spirit.

65,Got back from therapist.. and it was useless... she only questioned me why i dont work and why i dont have any meaning in this life... useless visit for a useless person.. well i guess its time to stop this..,i am not sure what you are talking about
66,"Have you ever just stared blankly at a car's headlights as it speeds towards you, wishing that it would it would hit and kill you instantaneously?.

70,"I hate the good days. I'm really starting to hate any good days that I may have. I get one every month or so and it's quite possibly worse than just being depressed. It dosent matter how happy I am or how much I try, I know it will be right back. And worse than a normal day. After a few hours I fall right back down. I honestly don't know why I'm still alive. My life has just been a series of fuck ups. I should be a functioning adult by now and yet I can barely think straight. I'm just running in circles, I do the minimum to survive. Daydreaming is my only escape and even my depression is inhibiting that. Why, why me, why any of us. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.","well , at least you have a good time for them ."
71,"Maybe I'm not depressed. Maybe I just don't like living.. I mean, I don't seem to have ANY depressive symptoms except being generally dissatisfied with life and being suicidal. None of the drugs worked. None of the shrinks helped. Maybe living really is just a shitty, boring thing in aggregate.",i 'm sorry you feel that way . i hope you find someone better soon .
72,I feel numb. This year has been so hard. I have never felt loneliness like I have this year. Overwhelming feelings of sadness and despair wash over me as I am just walking long the road or sat at work. It takes so much energy to pretend to be normal for family or colleagues. I am so tired. My day used to be happy. I used to find joy in things but there is no joy left. But I know that I don't feel empty. Far from empty as there is so much darkness inside me. I feel numb. Does anyone else feel nub?,you can get a lot of work at home and try to hang out with them and get the rest of the quiet .
73,"Anyone else has nothing worth living for?. No friends, no job prospects, no romantic success to look forward to. Makes life look like an utterly pointless waste of time. Anyone else struggling with this?",i understand . i can see why you feel that way .
74,"Anyone take mental health days from work?. Do you use vacation, PTO, sick, FMLA?",that 's great . what is your meeting about ?

Common saying out there that suicide is selfish, but what a lot of non-suicidal people don't understand is that people who are suicidal know that the people around them will have better lives if they were not in it and know that being alive is selfish.",i hope she turns out alright .
76,"Sometimes I wonder why I even try. I've never really overcome depression, because it always comes back worse than before. This is the worst I've ever had; I can't go more than 5 minutes without thinking about suicide.",i am sure they are .
77,"I have been a Freshmen for 3, 1/2 years. I don't even blame my depression , I am just dumb. I was at community college for three years and now I am on academic probation in a university, this is my second semester here and I only have twelve credits to my name. I am trying , I really am but it's just hard and hopeless. The other day my parents told me we made room for your future degree , next to your siblings degrees! I am twenty-two years old going on twenty-three. I don't know what to do.",that is awesome . i hope you do n't have to retire one day !
78,Its silly how out of the blue it can hit you and ruin everything you built mentally up to that point.. especially during the ACT. fuck me.,oh no ! i 'm so sorry to hear that . how did you find out ?
79,It’s like I’m driving with no driving wheel. And just wishing for the car to hit a wall,that is scary ! i hate driving in those shoes .
80,Your entire reason for existing explained in one word.. Work. . . That's about it.,i 'm sorry to hear that . what made you feel that way ?

82,Anyone feel numb/epmpty. I don't really know of its depression but I figured you guys could help. I have this number feeling where I just don't feel emotions other then sad or angry I just feel empty. Like I'm just a shell with nothing inside just going through life. I don't really know what to do with myself I don't want to kill myself because it would hurt the people I care about most but at the same time I can't feel anything other then everything suck why am I here. It's really tough to even get out of bed in the morning all I want to do is cry. Does anyone have any ideas on coping with this numb/empty feeling because nothing makes me happy.,you should be more worried about it .
83,"Today is my birthday. I should be happy and shit, but I'm just empty. Does this happen to you, when you should be happy but your just empty? This sucks. Want this shit to end",i hope it turns out well for you .
84,Idk. It's 5 am and everything is hitting at once,that 's awesome ! what are you going to do ?
85,"Do any of you guys feel like me?. For some background, I'm 18 and in my freshman year of university. For a couple months now I've just been feeling sorta weird. It's like a long funk. I don't know how to describe it. If I had to choose, I'd say I feel empty or indifferent. I'm still able to laugh and find things funny, but a lot of the time I just feel like a machine, doing things because I have to. My motivation is minimal. A part of me is just not transitioning very well from high school to university. I don't like it here and I don't know how to describe it, either. Maybe out of place? Not fitting in? The environment here is just cold. I've been looking forward to sleeping more lately, but I dunno if that's just my exhaustion from late night studying/work or something else. I think I failed my chemistry exam and the course and it doesn't really phase me. I don't know what's wrong. Am I depressed? Do you guys feel similarly?",i 'm sorry to hear that . i hope you feel better soon .
86,"I'm curious about how anti-depressants have affected you. I've been dealing with depression since I was 12 (I'm nearly 19 now) and in the past, my doctor recommended anti-depressants. I was hesitant because I've had friends say it essentially makes you feel like an emotionless robot, so I ended up declining that option entirely. I feel like my depression has only gotten worse and worse and am now looking to meds as a last resort.

Thank you all &lt;3","well , at least you 're concerned about it . i hope you can figure out what they do ."

89,"Feeling dead inside. For the last 1-2 weeks feeling nothing inside, like most of the other people, dont know what to do. Thoughts in the middle of the night well, i might die, i dont have what to live for. Literally void of nothing, black space.",i 'm sorry to hear that . i hope he is doing better now .
90,"Feel like I'm forgetting what enjoyment is. Time with my partner doesn't feel fulfilling, not like it did. Even my zoo job feels routine; I don't do much there, and today, I feel dull to it. I hate this; I don't deserve numbness, I should be grateful for my life. Depression, thieving fucker..",i hope you enjoy it !
91,The 20's. Are the 20's supposed to suck this bad. I want to fast forward to when my life gets better. Kind of like a click remote.,that is a smart move .

94,Feeling nervous when happy. So yesterday I felt happy for the first time in a while and switched from my depressing music to my happy music.
